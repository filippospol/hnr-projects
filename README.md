Welcome to the Hack n Roll Github repository. In here, you will find some of the coding and programming work we have conducted for our daily research and weekly podcast episodes.

More specifically, there are some automated actions that update our [NBA Statistics Database](https://fp-dev.shinyapps.io/hack-n-roll/), as well as some other projects that will be added in the near future.
